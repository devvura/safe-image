## üìñ Description  
**Safe Image** is an AI-powered image filtering library designed to promote safe and culturally appropriate content.  
The library uses advanced deep learning models to automatically detect and blur inappropriate or sensitive content in images, with full control over the blur strength, ensuring that visuals remain respectful and aligned with Islamic values.

## üöÄ How to Use  

### Installation  

1. Make sure **Maven Central** is added to your project-level `build.gradle` (or `settings.gradle` for Gradle 7+):  

```gradle
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
}
```

2. Add **Safe Image** in module-level `build.gradle`:  

```
dependencies {
    implementation("com.example:safe-image:1.0.0")
}
```

### 1. Jetpack Compose Usage  

#### Minimal Usage  

If you only want to display an image with automatic safe blurring, you can use **SafelImage** with just the `model` parameter:  

```kotlin
SafeImage(
    model = "https://example.com/sample.jpg",
    contentDescription = "Sample Image"
)
```

#### Customizable Usage  

You can fully customize **SafeImage** by providing parameters such as `loadingContent`, `errorContent`, `onBlurContent`, `blurRadius`, and more:  

```kotlin
SafeImage(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    model = "https://example.com/sample.jpg",
    contentDescription = "Sample Image",
    loadingContent = { Text(text = "Loading...") },
    errorContent = { Text(text = "Error loading image") },
    onBlurContent = { Text(text = "Sensitive content")},
    blurRadius = 20.dp,
    contentScale = ContentScale.FillWidth
)
```

### 2. XML Usage

#### Minimal Usage  

If you only want to display an image with automatic safe blurring, you can use **SafeImage** with just the `model` parameter:  

```kotlin
val imageView = findViewById<ImageView>(R.id.imageView1)
imageView.loadSafeImage(
    model = "https://example.com/sample.jpg",

```kotlin
val imageView = findViewById<ImageView>(R.id.imageView1)
imageView.loadSafeImage(
    model = "https://example.com/sample.jpg",
    blurRadius = 70,
    onLoading = { 
        Toast.makeText(context, "Loading image...", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show() 
    },
    onError = { 
        Toast.makeText(context, "Failed to load image", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show() 
    },
    onSuccess = { 
        Toast.makeText(context, "Image loaded successfully!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show() 
    },
    crossFadeEnabled = true,
    placeholderRes = R.drawable.loading_bar,
    errorDrawableRes = R.drawable.error_svgrepo_com
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How Does It Work?  

Safe Image integrates seamlessly with Coil‚Äôs image loading pipeline, working specifically on the **Transformation step** to detect and blur unsafe images before they are displayed.  
This ensures maximum performance and that sensitive content never flashes on the screen unblurred.

</p>



When you load an image with **Safe Image**, it is first passed through Coil‚Äôs request pipeline, which includes a custom transformation. This transformation uses an AI-powered detector to analyze the image before it is displayed. If the detector identifies unsafe content, the image is blurred with a configurable blur radius; otherwise, it is shown normally.  

Under the hood, the detection is powered by a TensorFlow Lite model trained to distinguish between safe and unsafe content. Each image is resized, normalized, and classified, and if the probability of sensitive content exceeds a threshold, the image is flagged as haram.  

To ensure smooth performance, Coil‚Äôs memory and disk caching are enabled so images are not repeatedly processed.

## üìä Model & Dataset   

- The AI model was trained on a custom dataset consisting of **11,304 images**, categorized as either **safe** or **unsafe**.  
- The **unsafe category** includes **5,652 images** containing sensitive or explicit content.  
- The **safe category** also contains **5,652 images**, featuring appropriate content such as individuals in everyday attire, including hijabi women, men, and women in normal contexts.  
- To improve generalization and accuracy, the dataset was carefully collected from individuals of **diverse nationalities**.  
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of **96% on the training set** and **94% on the testing set**, effectively covering the majority of sensitive content detection cases, with only a few exceptions.  
- The deployed **TFLite model size** is **~10 MB**.  
- Supported image formats: **PNG**, **JPG**, **JPEG2000**, and **WEBP**.
